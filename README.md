# The Impact of Covid-19 in Open Source Software Development

During the COVID-19, people had to change their habits in order to keep up with new regulations and changes. The concept of working from home is one of these changes. The working from home model, especially in the software industry, was quickly adapted and started to be implemented. In this project, carried out within the scope of PURE (Program for Undergraduate Research), it is investigated how the software developers were affected during the COVID-19 period, and whether various factors and situation itself played a role in the development of the software.

- Exploratory Analysis

Before looking at the period of COVID-19, the entire history of the GitHub project is examined in order to conduct exploratory data analysis in general.

- User-based Research

After the exploratory analysis of the general data, user-based research is conducted and analysis on the monthly and yearly commit graphs of the most committed 5 users were made.

- Comparison Phase

Pre and Post-COVID data were compared in order to examine whether COVID caused changes in the working habits of software developers.
